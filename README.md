Introducing CollegePlan, a mobile money Manager and THE solution to finance mismanagement. Our target is students but the application can serve anyone with money management problems. CollegePlan will primarily be built as a mobile application.

This application is intended to minimize as much as possible, money mismanagement in our communities especially the youths getting into the job market. It will provide the following functionalities in order to achieve this objective;

Student block Account This functionality is intended to be used by the user to block a chosen percentage of any momo income for a period(a semester, 1 year or even 3 years) chosen and not modifiable. This option will force a student to be their sponsor (by saving money) as they graduate from the university. The percentage a student will be able to block will fall under a certain margin deemed reasonable based on the frequency of recharge (how often is his/her account refilled). It could be possible to go past this margin but only if the client (user) is really willing to.

Budget Manager This functionality will block a student momo balance and allow withdrawal of a certain amount regularly after a chosen amount of hours(days, etc). This options will help a student who has poor money management skills or parent who don't trust their children to give money in hand.

Trusted Bussiness This option helps a user pay for a service or good. The receiver of the money(or seller) will be able to withdraw the money only when the buyer confirms having received the goods. *The buyer can receive the good and cancel the trade, and in that case, the money won't be of any use to either, only when they resolve the issue now at an MTN's office will they be able to have access to it. ( This policy is to protect the buyer and/or seller in case one the party have shady intentions) *

Manage MTN MoMo Basic everyday mobile money functionalities ( Money sending, credit purchase, internet purchase, etc).

Bank link This functionality will allow connection to any chosen existing user bank account for easy withdrawal and deposits.
